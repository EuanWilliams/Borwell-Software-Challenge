# Borwell-Software-Challenge

Borwell Software Challenge code written in c# for work experience application, calculating the area of the floor, amount of paint needed to paint the walls, and the volume of the room.

It asks the user to input the lenght, width and height of the room, which are then stored as integers to be used in the calculations. For working out the area of the floor I used the simple calculation "width x length". To work out the amount of paint needed I worked out the area of the walls and then used the constant 1 litre as the constant value needed to cover 10m^2 of wall, which I use to divide the area of the walls, giving the total number of litres needed to paint the walls. Finally, for the volume of the room I have used the calculation for "volume, length x width x height".

The code is made up of one .cs source code file called Room_Calculations.cs.
